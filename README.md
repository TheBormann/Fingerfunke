# About the Project
**Fingerfunke** is an innovative mobile application designed to connect people through the unique medium of sign language. This app emerges from the collective effort of a vibrant team of developers and sign language enthusiasts who first joined forces at a hackathon in the autumn of 2020. Since then, we have dedicated ourselves to transforming our vision into reality, with our hearts set on unveiling a prototype in 2022.

Our platform caters specifically to those fluent in sign language—whether they are hearing, hard of hearing, deaf, late-deafened, or cochlear implant users. Fingerfunke enables users to create and discover groups based on varied interests and activities in their local area, making it easier to find and connect with like-minded individuals. What sets Fingerfunke apart is its commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, offering all information in video format to ensure a visually rich user experience.

**Local Everywhere**: Whether you are new to a city or eager to kickstart something new in your local community, Fingerfunke helps you find and connect with other sign language users nearby.

**Connect and Engage**: Perfect for those learning German Sign Language or seeking companionship for events, our app encourages users to establish their own groups and start communicating in a visual and engaging manner.
